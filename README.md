The Library Management System is a web application designed to streamline the management of library operations. 
It allows librarians to manage books, members, and transactions efficiently. The system provides functionalities for book inventory management, member registration, and borrowing/returning books. 
It is built with a Django backend to handle the server-side operations and APIs, and a React frontend for the user interface.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: React, Redux (for state management), React Router, Axios (for API calls), Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap (for styling)
Backend: Django, Django REST Framework (for API development), PostgreSQL/MySQL (for database)

Key Features:

User Authentication:
Users can register and log in as either librarians or members.
Authentication is managed using JWT tokens.

Book Management:
Librarians can add, update, delete, and view books in the inventory.
Search functionality to find books by title, author, genre, or ISBN.

Member Management:
Registration of new members with necessary details.
Viewing and editing member profiles.
Track members’ borrowing history.

Borrowing and Returning Books:
Members can borrow available books, which updates the book status and inventory.
Return functionality that checks the book back into the library and updates the record.

Transaction Management:
Track and manage all book borrowing and returning transactions.
Display due dates, late fees, and transaction history.

Dashboard:
For librarians: A dashboard showing key metrics like total books, active members, and overdue books.
For members: A personalized dashboard showing borrowed books, due dates, and recommendations.

Project Workflow:

Frontend (React):
The React frontend consumes APIs provided by the Django backend.
UI components are built using React, with routing managed by React Router.
Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the Django backend.
State management handled by Redux or Context API to manage the application state.

Backend (Django):
Django serves as the backend framework, using Django REST Framework to create RESTful APIs.
The backend handles user authentication, book management, member management, and transactions.
A relational database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) stores the data with models for books, members, and transactions.
Django’s admin panel can be used for initial management and data entry.
